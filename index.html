                                    Hi! I'm a student game programmer currently attending Champlain College. I am particularly interested in graphics, but I am passionate about all kinds of programming. I love Math, Literature, <a href="http://nuts4nuts.com/" target="_blank">Nuts4Nuts</a>, writing implements and Prince. I get excited about tiny things.

        	        Working with two designers, three producers, an artist, and two other programmers to make an elegant, ambient, stylish action game in Unity 5.<br><br>
                    The team of Ripples came together in the mutual desire to make a stylish, polished game by the end of the year. This has been the culmination of our team's collective experience with action games, Unity, and friction in games through our time at Champlain College. We started the game with half of the team in the first semester of the year, and have expanded to the current size for the second semester.

					Worked with a designer, producer, artist, and another programmer to make a networked strategy game in Unity 4.6.<br><br>
					In developing Infection I learned so much about user experience. A videogame must teach the player how to play, and that is no small task. Throughout the whole production cycle we focused on being meticulous about making everything clear to the player. We have worked very hard to make sure that every action has ample sign and feedback..

					Worked with a designer, producer, and artist over four weeks to make a mobile puzzle-platformer in Flash.<br><br>
					This project taught me a lot about thinking about platform. In targeting mobile devices, I worked with the designer to design controls and levels that feel good, and with the artist to get around the graphical limitations of the platform.

					Working with an artist to make a competitive local multiplayer game in Unity 4.6.<br><br>
					This project has let me experiment a lot with satisfaction. There is a lot of talk these days about game feel, or friction; this is my platform for learning about it. I have tried to make every piece of feedback react to the state of the game.

			    <p>
Rigid Motors is a mobile game I worked on with an <a href="http://www.walterweaver.com">artist</a>, producer, and two designers. It is a mobile puzzle-platformer game made using Flash with the Citrus engine. In Rigid Motors you play as an infinite supply of robot minions, trying to find treasure in ancient catacombs. The catacombs are treacherous, filled with spikes, lava, and all manner of other nasty traps. Fortunately, when one robot dies it leaves its corpse behind to be used as a platform for later minions. The odds of any given robot getting the treasure are small, but together they will prevail.<br><br> This project taught me a lot about thinking about platform. In targeting mobile devices, I worked with the designer to design controls and levels that felt good, and with the artist to get around the graphical limitations of the platform.
</p><h6>
Controls
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
For the controls of Rigid Motors, we wanted to keep it simple. The team all agreed that mobile games work best when they use simple touch controls. That being said, we wanted to provide deep platforming gameplay. We decided that the game worked best as a sort of finite-runner. We would keep the level format, but we would have the robots constantly run. This let us trim down the control scheme. In the final implementation, the controls are simply tap to jump (when the robot is against a wall it does a wall jump and turns around) and swipe to self-destruct. We found that self-destruction was a crucial mechanic in letting the player forge a unique path through each level.

				Infection
                            </h1>
			    <p>
Infection was my junior production project that I was working on with an <a href="http://www.nickcomeau.com">artist</a>, producer, designer, and programmer. It's a two player asymmetrical abstract strategy game, with drafting. One player plays as human immune system cells, and one player plays as invasive agents, such as bacteria and viruses. Each team has five pieces, which all have unique abilities. In the first stage, players snake-draft three pieces, and place them in their starting zones. Then they are given two low power pieces (like pawns), and they start the tactics stage where they fight over the board. The immune cells' goal is to wipe out the invaders, while the invaders' goal is to infect a certain percentage of the board.
</p><h6>
Teaching the Player
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
Working on infection taught me a great deal about presenting information to the player. We were trying to make an elegant abstract strategy game, and in doing so we focused on making every bit of information clear, yet inconspicuous. We worked a lot on non-textual cues. For instance, we repeatedly found in testing that players were having problems knowing whose turn it was, and which pieces could move. We didn't want to throw around popups every second saying exactly what was happening, but we did want it to be clear. In the final form of the game, just about everything related to each player lights up when it's their turn, and pieces have two different effects indicating that they can move. By our final presentation, players were starting to get the message.

				Ripples
                            </h1>
			    <p>
Ripples is my senior production game that I am currently working on with two designers, three producers, an artist, and two other programmers. It is an elegant, stylish action game for one or two players. Players play as mathematical symbols, like Theta and Delta, dueling on a watery plane. Each encounter is set to a musical track. The characters jump to the beat of the track, and dance around in simultaneous defence and offense. When the characters land, they create a ripple in the surface of the water. If you hit your opponents ripple, you take damage. The characters have unique abilities based on their commong mathematical usage. For example, Delta usually stands for rate of change, so the Delta character has a special ripple that Delta can shrink and expand at will.
</p><h6>
Chill Out and Freak Out
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
In developing Ripples, we discovered that there are two distinct types of players that are attracted to the game. The first type of player, who most of the developers identify with, wants to have an intense action game experience. This was our initial goal in concepting, prototyping, and developing Ripples. The second type of player, who we didn't expect at all, wants to chill out with the game, get in the zone, and relax with the sweet tunes. Though we weren't designing the game for this purpose, we realized that Ripples really lends itself to this type of experience through its minmal, engaging graphics and stylish music. We did not anticipate this duality in the audience of Ripples, but ever since we found it we have fought to keep it. We have done this through careful balance and a focus on the aesthetics of the game.

                            </h1>
			    <p>
Vicious Orb is a project that I am currently working on alone (hence the <a href="http://braid-game.com">Tim</a> sprites). Vicious orb is about leaping into the air, grabbing a ball made of a highly instable material, and blasting it at your friend before your feet touch the ground. Vicious orb is about playing basketball with a nuclear bomb. Vicious orb is what CERN scientists do during their lunch hour. In Vicious Orb I am trying to make a hilariously fun, competitive, local multiplayer game, becuase those are the kinds of games I like to play.
</p><h6>
Making it Juicy
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
Vicious Orb is meant to be a very visceral game. It is a competitive action game, I want it to feel good. To do that, I have been spending a lot of time tweaking the feedback of the game. My goal is to make it so that every graphical and aural effect is scaled to the tension of the current game state. I've learned a lot in doing this. Getting to be the designer of the game as well as programming it has made me think more about what designers really need to make the games they want to make. This has also encouraged me to work on more small projects. I have been working on this in my spare time for a little while now, but I finished the first prototype in a few hours.

				Business Card Game
                            </h1>
			    <p>
In anticipation of GDC 2016, I was scrambling around for a business card idea. This would be my first personal business card, so I wanted to make it special. I wanted my business card to reflect my personality; my love of math, games, and little programs. I wanted the cards to have some kind of function or game, so that people recieving them would have a reason to not immediately discard them. I came across <a href="https://moo.com">Moo's</a> offer of up to fifty different card backs for no extra charge, and knew that I needed to make some sort of randomly generated game.
</p><h6>
Graph Theory
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
I got to thinking about the possible games one could fit on a business card, and decided an abstract puzzle sort of thing would be best given the strict restraints of the platform. A few facts from graph theory popped into my mind and, bam, I had my randomly generatable puzzle game. The idea is that I would randomly generate graphs with Euler circuits, Euler paths, and Hamiltonian circuits, give each graph a unique id number, and provide little instructions for how the graph can be traversed. The methods for generating these graphs are fairly simple, it all comes down to the number of connections between nodes, here's how it works: <br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>If no nodes have an odd number of connections, the graph contains an Euler circuit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If exactly two nodes have an odd number of connections, the graph contains an Euler path.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If we take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph">line graph</a> of a graph with an Euler circuit, it will contain a Hamiltonian circuit.</p>

        <p>Note: If more than two nodes have an odd number of connections, the graph has none of these properties! (Also, it is impossible for only one node to have an odd number of connections.)</p>

For my program, we always generate an Euler circuit graph then, depending on the type of graph we desire, we either leave it alone, prune (or add) an edge (to get an Euler path), or take its line graph (to get a Hamiltonian circuit). From there we place nodes randomly, attempting to give them as much space as possible within the business card dimensions, then we draw edges between the nodes. Finally, we simply take a screen shot of the generated graph, instruction text, and id number, and export it to a png for use as a potential card back.
