                                    Hi! I'm a student game programmer currently attending Champlain College. I am particularly interested in graphics, but I have passion for all kinds of programming. I love Math, Literature, <a href="http://nuts4nuts.com/" target="_blank">Nuts4Nuts</a>, writing implements and Prince. I get excited about tiny things.

				    Worked with a designer, producer, and artist over four weeks to make a mobile puzzle-platformer in Flash.<br><br>
This project taught me a lot about thinking about platform. In targeting mobile devices, I worked with the designer to design controls and levels that feel good, and with the artist to get around the graphical limitations of the platform.

                                    <p>
				    Worked with two other programmers to develop an implementation of the apriori algorithm for large data sets. Focused on optimizing for time at the cost of memory.<br><br>
This project taught me an incredibly valuable lesson: always communicate. We were expected to work on the project over spring break, but as soon as I got home my computer died. I was focused on getting it back in working order, and forgot to communicate my dilemma to my teammates. Two days later, I got my computer running and told the team what happened, but the time was still gone. The project got finished; it just took some extra stress and train-programming. From then on I’ve made sure to inform my team at the first sign of any sizable problem.

				    Worked alone on an arena shoot ‘em up for PC and Xbox 360. Implemented many techniques of 2d graphics programming, including parallax scrolling, a particle system, and pixel shaders in HLSL.<br><br>
				    This project introduced me to the creativity of graphics programming. Though the techniques implemented were very simple, it gave me a taste of the joy of turning math into beauty. There are many facets to creating a great game, but the one which strikes us most immediately and frequently is the visual aesthetic. This project made me realize that graphics programming beautifully combines two of my favorite things: math and art.

				    Worked with a team to create an arcade cabinet for a one button game (Gamma IV, by Cactus).<br><br>
                                    This was the first project that really made me think about controls and presentation when it comes to videogames. We already knew what kind of game we were working with, but we had to create an arcade cabinet that would both mesh well with the existing systems of the game as well as attract people to play. It was a lot of fun getting to create a unique presentation for a game, and showing our work at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City.

                            </h1>
			    <p>
Rigid Motors is a mobile game I worked on with an <a href="http://www.walterweaver.com">artist</a>, producer, and two designers. It is a mobile puzzle-platformer game made using Flash with the Citrus engine. In Rigid Motors you play as an infinite supply of robot minions, trying to find treasure in ancient catacombs. The catacombs are treacherous, filled with spikes, lava, and all manner of other nasty traps. Fortunately, when one robot dies it leaves its corpse behind to be used as a platform for later minions. The odds of any given robot getting the treasure are small, but together they will prevail.<br><br> This project taught me a lot about thinking about platform. In targeting mobile devices, I worked with the designer to design controls and levels that felt good, and with the artist to get around the graphical limitations of the platform. 
</p><h6>
Controls
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
For the controls of Rigid Motors, we wanted to keep it simple. The team all agreed that mobile games work best when they use simple touch controls. That being said, we wanted to provide deep platforming gameplay. We decided that the game worked best as a sort of finite-runner. We would keep the level format, but we would have the robots constantly run. This let us trim down the control scheme. In the final implementation, the controls are simply tap to jump (when the robot is against a wall it does a wall jump and turns around) and swipe to self-destruct. We found that self-destruction was a crucial mechanic in letting the player forge a unique path through each level.

                            </h1>
			    <p>
Infection is a current project that I am working on with an <a href="http://www.nickcomeau.com">artist</a>, producer, designer, and programmer. It's a two player asymmetrical abstract strategy game, with drafting. One player plays as human immune system cells, and one player plays as invasive agents, such as bacteria and viruses. Each team has five pieces, which all have unique abilities. In the first stage, players snake-draft three pieces, and place them in their starting zones. Then they are given two low power pieces (like pawns), and they start the tactics stage where they fight over the board. The immune cells' goal is to wipe out the invaders, while the invaders' goal is to infect a certain percentage of the board.
</p><h6>
Teaching the Player
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
Working on infection has taught me a great deal about presenting information to the player. We are trying to make an elegant abstract strategy game, and in doing so we are focusing on making every bit of information clear, yet inconspicuous. We have worked a lot on non-textual cues. For instance, we repeatedly found in testing that players were having problems knowing whose turn it was, and which pieces could move. We didn't want to throw around popups every second saying exactly what was happening, but we did want it to be clear. At this point, just about everything related to a player lights up when it's their turn, and pieces have two different effects indicating that they can move. Players are starting to get the message. The game still has a long way to go, but it is shaping up nicely so far.

This is an arcade cabinet I made with a team of four, for the <a href="http://www.moma.org/learn/teens/index">New York City Museum of Modern Art</a> and <a href="http://babycastles.com/">Babycastles</a>. We were tasked with making an arcade cabinet for a one-button game. The cabinet had to have an interesting control scheme that fit into the theme of the game. Our game was <a href="http://cactusquid.blogspot.com/2009/12/gamma-iv-donations.html">Gamma IV, by Cactus</a>. Gamma IV is a game of symmetry, screenshake, and strobing lights.
</p><h6>
The Cabinet
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
None of us had experience with designing or building an arcade cabinet before, so first we got to thinking about what we like in arcade cabinets. We all agreed that we like tight controls, good theming, and eye-catching design. Gamma IV is a flashy game, so we didn't think we would have a problem catching people's eyes. We wanted to go with something powerful, mysterious, and symmetrical, so we decided on a pyramid as our basic shape. We also liked the idea of pressing down on the top of a pyramid to make something happen. Who doesn't want to press the top of a pyramid? We wanted our pyramid to complement the flashiness of the game, so we covered it in reflective mylar and strapped some lights to it. Finally, we put a little kneeling pad at the base of the pyramid so the player could truly feel the glory of Gamma IV.

				Vicious Orb
                            </h1>
			    <p>
Vicious Orb is a project that I am currently working on alone (hence the <a href="http://braid-game.com/">Tim</a> sprites). Vicious orb is about leaping into the air, grabbing a ball made of a highly instable material, and blasting it at your friend before your feet touch the ground. Vicious orb is about playing basketball with a nuclear bomb. Vicious orb is what CERN scientists do during their lunch hour. In Vicious Orb I am trying to make a hilariously fun, competitive, local multiplayer game, becuase those are the kinds of games I like to play.
</p><h6>
Making it Juicy
</h6><div class="break"></div><p>
Vicious Orb is meant to be a very visceral game. It is a competitive action game, I want it to feel good. To do that, I have been spending a lot of time tweaking the feedback of the game. My goal is to make it so that every graphical and aural effect is scaled to the tension of the current game state. I've learned a lot in doing this. Getting to be the designer of the game as well as programming it has made me think more about what designers really need to make the games they want to make. This has also encouraged me to work on more small projects. I have been working on this in my spare time for a little while now, but I finished the first prototype in a few hours.
